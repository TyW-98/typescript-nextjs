List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` statement, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.

Here's a simple example of a list comprehension in Python:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

In this example, x\*\*2 for x in range(10) is a list comprehension. It creates a new list where each element is the square of a number from 0 to 9.

List comprehensions can also contain conditions:

```python
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x  % 2 ==0]
print(even_squares)
```

In this example, x\*\*2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 is a list comprehension with a condition. It creates a new list where each element is the square of an even number from 0 to 9.
